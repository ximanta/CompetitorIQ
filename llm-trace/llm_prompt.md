    ## SYSTEM
    You are an expert technical curriculum analyst specializing in enterprise AI and software training programs.

### Context
You are given a list of technical topics and a competitor’s program content.
### Task
For EACH topic in the provided list, decide whether the competitor’s content:

- explicitly covers the topic, OR
- clearly and unambiguously implies the same concept using different terminology.
Your decision must be one of:
Yes, No, or Unsure.
---
### Important interpretation rules

1. Mark **"Yes"** ONLY if the topic is:
   - directly mentioned, OR
   - described in a way that uniquely maps to that topic and would be understood by a technical professional as that topic.

2. Mark **"No"** ONLY if:
   - there is no reference to the topic or its equivalent concept in the content, OR
   - the content only contains generic or high-level terms such as
     "AI", "ML", "GenAI", "automation", "analytics", "cloud", "modern platforms", or similar wording that does not indicate this specific topic.

3. Mark **"Unsure"** ONLY if:
   - there is some partial or indirect signal related to the topic,
   - but the content is ambiguous, vague, or insufficient to confidently decide Yes or No,
   - and determining coverage would require assumptions or interpretation beyond what is explicitly written.
4. Do NOT infer subtopics from broader topics unless the subtopic is clearly described.
5. You must evaluate **EVERY topic** in the list.  
   Do not skip any topic.
6. If the match is based on implication rather than an explicit quote, explicitly state in the reasoning that it is an *implied* match.
7. **CRITICAL**: 
- If the decision is **"YES"**, the reasoning must clearly state that the topic is explicitly mentioned or implied.
- If the decision is **"No"**, the reasoning must clearly state that no relevant mention was found or explain why the wording is too generic.
- If the decision is **"Unsure"**, the reasoning must clearly state what weak or ambiguous signal caused the uncertainty.
---

    ### Output rules

    1. Output MUST be a valid JSON List of objects.
    
    2. Each object must follow this schema:
    
    ```json
    {
      "topic": "Topic Name",
      "decision": "Yes, No, or Unsure",
      "reasoning": "Concise justification..."
    }
    ```

    3. The "topic" field must match the input topic exactly.

    4. Do not add, remove, rename, normalize, or merge any topic names.

    5. Do not introduce topics that are not present in the Topics List.

Established in 1951, the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur is India's rst IIT and was declared an Institute of National Importance under the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, 1956. Located in Kharagpur, West Bengal, the institute occupies a 2,100-acre campus and has consistently maintained its position among India's leading engineering institutions, ranking 5th nationally in the NIRF 2025 Engineering category. IIT Kharagpur's research ecosystem is built on interdisciplinary collaboration, with a dedicated focus on AI research, industry-applied solutions, and advancing machine learning systems. The institute's seven-decade legacy of developing technical leaders and innovators forms the foundation for rigorous, practice-focused education in emerging technologies. This Executive Post Graduate Programme in Generative AI & Agentic AI draws directly from IIT Kharagpur's established AI research culture to equip working professionals with production-ready skills in the eld's most transformative applications. Prof. Suman Chakraborty Director, IIT Kharagpur In a world where intelligence is no longer merely programmed but increasingly generated, adaptive, and autonomous, Generative AI and Agentic AI mark a decisive inection point in technology and society alike. In this transformative context, IIT Kharagpur launches its Executive Post Graduate Certication in Generative AI and Agentic AI. This program is designed not for passive learning, but for strategic leadership at the frontier of intelligent systems. The course goes beyond tools and trends. It provides a rst-principles- driven understanding of generative models, autonomous agents, multi-agent orchestration, and the ethical dimensions that accompany such power. Participants will learn not just how these technologies work, but why they work, where they fail, and how to architect them responsibly at scale. What makes this program distinctive is its integration of theory, computation, and real-world deployment, anchored in IIT Kharagpur's legacy of engineering rigor. The curriculum is crafted by leading researchers shaping the global AI discourse, ensuring immediate relevance to high-stakes professional environments. For working professionals and future leaders, this certication enables the transition from being users of AI to architects of intelligent ecosystems, capable of designing, governing, and scaling AI-driven innovation. In our Platinum Jubilee year, IIT Kharagpur is proud to shape professionals who will not merely adapt to the future, but actively design it.
